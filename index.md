This is a documentation of my undergraduate thesisâ€”Keyword Spotting Using Convolutional Neural Network on Microcontroller-based Board as a Smart Switch for Devices. Basically, the prototype provided in the thesis is a voice-controlled smart switch for two devices. The trigger keywords are _one_, _two_, _on_, and _off_. _One_ and _two_ are used to switch between the two devices, while _on_ and _off_, quite intuitively, are used to turn the devices on or off. Here is a [demonstration video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5sMkls3ZtQ) of the prototype.

Proceeding to the discussion of terms for easier discussion, keyword spotting (KWS) is a machine learning algorithm that is used to detect certain keywords from a stream of live audio. As for convolutional neural network (CNN), it is used in KWS to classify the keywords, CNN is a deep learning architecture commonly used for image classification. Lastly, microcontroller (MCU) is an embedded device found in almost all of commonly used electronic gadget, it can be simply described as a less-powerful  miniature version of a computer. Arduino is a common development board that uses microcontroller.

Since audio is a 1D signal and images are 2D, feature extraction is first performed on audio to convert it into 2D signal. One sample of algorithm used
